      "description": "**Why you might get asked this:** Interviewers gauge your understanding of state management solutions in JavaScript, ensuring you can choose the right tool for different scenarios, such as optimizing performance in large-scale applications.\n\n**How to answer:**\n- Define Redux as a predictable state container for JavaScript apps\n- Explain that Redux uses a single store for state management, while Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without props\n- Highlight that Redux is more suitable for complex state logic and large applications, whereas Context API is ideal for simpler state management needs\n\n**Example answer:**\nRedux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps that centralizes the state in a single store, making it easier to manage and debug. In contrast, Context API allows for passing data through the component tree without props, which is simpler but less powerful for complex state management."

This means the entire state of the application is stored in one object, can only be changed by dispatching actions, and those changes are handled by pure functions called reducers."
